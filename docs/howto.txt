Jinx reads an X3D based in a URL, it is specified in the function X3D() from Engine class. It is called now from main.cpp
also there is a configuration file used to define some parameters of each computer. There is only one file for all nodes.

The X3D file is read in each computer, that needs it. Also it reads the textures and sound necessary. 
Jinx uses a cache diretory to hold the textures and sound. It is the .cache directory.

The MPI is used to dispatch the applications in the cluster, in the case the mpirun is used. There is a script that do it automaticaly.
This script is called "main"
It is very important that all node of the cluster have the same user loged in.
